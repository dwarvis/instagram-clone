INSTAGRAM CLONE - DAVIS AND JOSHUA

For step 2, we did one and a half things. We fixed the comments, however, we weren't
actually sure how we achieved this, and therefore we chose to also do another extension in order to
challenge ourselves. So then, we added a messaging system. This took two main steps to accomplish:
Firstly, we had to design a UI for the users to type in and receive messages, we changed the
existing fragment_messages.xml in order to do this. Secondly, we had to take the messages that were
typed in, and send them to other people, we did this by sending the messages to firebase and then D
taking them from firebase on a separate device. However, the way this messaging system works is not
the same as the conventional instagram direct messaging system. Due to difficulties with sending
messages directly to other accounts, we opted to instead create a giant group chat of every user
of our instagram clone. So if someone was to send a message, then everyone using the clone would be
able to see it.
